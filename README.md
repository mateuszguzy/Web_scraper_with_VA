Very simple looking web application for scraping data from Airbnb website.

It's searching for rentals in Denmark based on couple of factors defined by user (e.g. how many adults are coming or is user bringing any pets). 

Acquired results can be filtered by location, maximum possible guests, price (with live currency converter) or offer title.

Application has implemented voice assistant which will handle filling the form based on user's answers.
